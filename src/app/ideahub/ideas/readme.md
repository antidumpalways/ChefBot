# 💡 Idea Hub – Flavor AI

Welcome to the **Idea Hub** — a dedicated space inside Flavor AI where contributors can propose and explore **mini project ideas**, **feature revamps**, or **experimental concepts** to make the platform better, more fun, and more community-driven!

## 🧠 What is Idea Hub?

The Idea Hub is like a digital whiteboard — a collection of bite-sized ideas that contributors can build, test, or prototype. These ideas are not full standalone projects but smaller components or enhancements that can live within the Flavor AI ecosystem.

Think:  
- Recipe personalization modules  
- New filtering or sorting ideas  
- Student-specific tools like **Budget Bowl**  
- Accessibility improvements  
- UI/UX enhancements

## 🗂️ Folder Structure

Each mini idea lives in its own folder inside `app/ideahub/ideas/<your_project_name>`
